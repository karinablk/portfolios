description: >
  Business-driven analyst transitioning into machine learning and data science, with 16+ years of experience in media, e-commerce, and strategic leadership. I combine a strong analytical mindset with hands-on skills in Python, SQL, data wrangling, and applied machine learning. My recent work includes a fraud detection project for a financial institution (data analysis phase), large-scale retail data modeling (Instacart), and big data processing with PySpark.

  Iâ€™m passionate about turning real-world business problems into data-driven solutions.
