### Featured Projects
[Instacart Reorder Prediction (Machine Learning, Python)](https://github.com/karinablk/instacart-project)
- Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of over 20 million records to understand user behavior and reorder trends in e-commerce.
- Engineered 20+ features across user, product, and time dimensions (e.g. reorder frequency, cart position, order timing) to enrich the model input.
- Carefully designed features to avoid data leakage by respecting the chronological sequence of orders and excluding target-period information.
- Achieved best performance with XGBoost, reaching a macro F1-score of 0.61, outperforming logistic regression, random forest, CatBoost, and a GRU deep learning model.

[Crypto Web Scraping & Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/karinablk/crypto-webscraping-project/tree/main)
- Collected live data from CoinMarketCap using a combination of Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests, and the CMC API, focusing on memecoins and top cryptocurrencies.
- Cleaned and transformed raw HTML data (1,500+ records, 15 features) from dynamic pages using custom Python functions to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and data formatting.
- Compared coins with verified vs. unverified circulating supply and analyzed memecoins in relation to Bitcoin to identify patterns in perceived value and volatility.
- Conducted exploratory analysis to compare market capitalization, volatility, volume, and performance metrics between memecoins and established coins.
- Visualized key patterns using matplotlib and seaborn, revealing insights into price behavior, market concentration, and speculative dynamics in the crypto space.

[Retail Analytics (Power BI, Python)](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMWNjN2QwOWEtZDIzNy00NWU1LWE1ZGItODg2MTAyZTkwNWFkIiwidCI6IjZmMGJiNzJmLTUzNzctNGRkZi05MzZhLWI2YzcyYmYyMWFlMiIsImMiOjF9)
- The Adventure Works dataset analysis revealed that the most popular product categories are accessories, bikes, and clothing, generating a total of $23.6 million in revenue.
- Sales from online channels have shown a significant increase over the past year, with a 15% growth rate and a total of $5.8 million in revenue generated through this channel.
- The most profitable customer segments are from the Pacific region, generating a total of $6.2 million in revenue, followed by the South Atlantic and Mountain regions.
- A key finding from the analysis is that the company's marketing campaign focusing on discounting products has not been effective, as the revenue generated from discounted products only accounts for 7% of the total revenue. It may be more effective to focus on other marketing strategies to increase sales.
